# CachingExample
This application is a playground/demonstrator on how complex data-fetching, caching, using and displaying could look like in a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose Application using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co).

## Architecture
The app uses a [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/) for caching and [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for online data retrieval.
